# fluid_simulation ðŸ’¦
#### It was hard to understand (and to be honest, I still don't understand much), but it's impossible not to try to create a fluid simulation!

## What is it and how does it work? :eyes:

What I want to say is that I don't really understand how it works, but I really wanted to try it, so you won't see my personal explanation in this README.    
But I will definitely come back to this project in the future and try to immerse myself in all the formulas and theory as much as possible, because I am damn interested in how calling a number of simple functions leads to such a result.. ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
